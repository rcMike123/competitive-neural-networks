# Competitive neural networks: a gentle introduction

This set of notebooks is a companion material to my series of articles on the [Starschema blog](https://medium.com/starschema-blog) discussing competitive neural networks. Unlike error-correction neural networks, to which the feedforward backpropagation neural nets you know and love belong, competitive neural networks have an entirely different idea of what neurons do, and indeed model different brain processes (associative or Hebbian learning versus the ventral stream's gradually more complex and semantic process of understanding). While these blog posts are far from giving you the complete lowdown, they're a fun introduction to the subject.

### Acknowledgments

The author wishes to thank [Starschema](https://www.starschema.net) for their generous research time allowance that has made the work on these posts and notebooks possible in the first place. I'd also like to thank my wife [Katie]() for putting up with me while I was working on this (it's been a busy few weeks)
